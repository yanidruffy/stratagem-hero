## Testing

### Console Logging
During the creation of the website, I extensively used 'console.log()' statements to debug and gain insights of my code behaviour.
Following key aspects were logged:
- Variable States
- Input Handling
- Function Execution
- Game Progression

### HTML Validator
HTML file has been validated using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

### CSS Validator
CSS file has been validated using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Javascript Code Analyzer
JS files have been analyzed by using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)<br>
During the analysis, both JS files were combined. Three warning messages were flagged by JSHint, but are considered non-critical and can be safely ignored.<br>
